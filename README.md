# Bayesian-Data-Analysis-Bechdel-Test

Sam Edds, Olivia Hackworth, Katherine Wilkinson

This was a project for Stats 551 W19 at the University of Michigan. 

We use hierarchical modeling and hierarchical regression to show that both genre and time influence whether a movie passes the Bechdel test. For any genre, newer movies have higher odds of passing the Bechdel test than older movies. Additionally, time matters more for some genres than others. All results have the caveat that the data are crowd-sourced, with limitations discussed.
